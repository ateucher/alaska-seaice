# Sea ice Extent in Alaska region

This website presents daily time series of sea ice extent and its anomaly within the management regions of Alaskan waters.

The website features sea ice extent data for three regions: the Alaskan Arctic, Northern Bering, and Eastern Bering Sea. The boundaries of these regions are defined by the Ecosystem Management Regions. 

Sea ice extent for each region is calculated using sea ice concentration data available from NOAA PolarWatch and is updated automatically when the new data are available.

Documentation for the calculation of sea ice extent is available on the [Polarwatch github repository]().


## Data

To compute the baseline sea ice extent, Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 monthly data were pulled from [PolarWatch](https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/catalog/ice-sq-nh-nsidc-cdr-v4/preview/?dataset=monthly&var=cdr_seaice_conc_monthly&time_min=2023-12-01T00:00:00Z&time_max=2023-12-01T00:00:00Z&proj=epsg3413&colorBar=KT_ice,,,0,1,).  

To provide a continuous and near-real-time time series of sea ice extent, the Near-real-time sea ice concentration product has been used.

__Climate Data Record (CDR) of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration__

This data set provides a CDR of sea ice concentration at 25 km resolution. Daily and monthly versions are available from 1978 to the most recent annual processing. The data are deemed of science quality. The product name is NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration, Version 4 (G02202).


__Near-real-time Sea Ice Concentration__

The NRT CDR of sea ice concentration at 25 km is updated daily and used while waiting for the annual processing of the science quality CDR described above. Daily and monthly versions are available. The product name is Near Real-Time NOAA/NSIDC Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record (G10016_v2).


__Polar Stereographic Grid Cell Area Values__

This dataset includes grid cell area values for the 25-km polar stereographic grid used for the sea ice concentration data.

## Methods and Workflow

Sea ice extent is calculated as the sum of the areas of each grid cell where the sea ice concentration meets or exceeds a specified threshold, indicating the presence of sea ice.

### Daily Sea ice extent

Let $sic_{ij}$ be the satellite estimated sea ice concentration (i.e., fraction) of the $ij^{th}$ grid cell.

Sea ice extent of a ${region}$ is defined as follows:

$$
\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\text{region,day}} = \sum_{i \in \text{xgrid}, j \in \text{ygrid}} seaice_{ij,\text{region,day}} \cdot \text{cellarea}_{ij,\text{region}}
$$

$$ 
\text {where} 
\ seaice_{ij,region,day} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } sic_{ij,\text{region,month}} \geq 0.15, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

__Workflow of Data Processing and Computation:__

1.  __Data Import for Baseline__ Import Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 within the specified regional boundaries to compute daily baseline.   the most recent annual processing within the specified regional boundaries.

2. __Data Import for most recent years__ Import Near-Real-Time sea ice concentration data to the CDR time series.

3. __Data Cleaning__ Remove all flag values (non-sea ice concentration values) from the dataset.

4. __Data Conversion__ Convert sea ice concentration values from fractions to binary values using a threshold of 0.15 (0 indicates no ice, 1 indicates ice presence).

4. __Sea Ice Extent Calculation__ Sum the grid cell areas across all grids to obtain the total sea ice extent within the regional boundaries.


### Daily sea ice extent baseline

The sea ice extent daily baseline was computed using sea ice extent from 1985 to 2015, and defined as follows: 

Let $sea\_ice\_ext_{d,y}$ be  $dth$ daily sea ice extent of the $yth$ year, sea ice extent baseline of a ${region}$ is defined as follows:

Mean Sea ice extent of a ${region}$ is defined as folows: 

$$
\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\text{region}} = Mean ( sea\_ice\_ext_{d,region,y \in [1985,2015]})
$$

### Data Processing

The data processing was performed using python code and the additional computation and data visualization were done using R.

## Metadata

Metadata follows the CF metadata standards and can be downloaded [here]().

## Intended Use

The intended use of the data summaries, which include sea ice extent baselines and anomalies, is to compare the recent year's sea ice extent against the approximately 30-year baseline of sea ice extent. It is important to note that no additional data cleaning has been performed beyond what is described here. Users are advised to conduct further evaluations of the data and analysis themselves.
