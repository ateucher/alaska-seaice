    "text": "This website presents daily time series of sea ice extent and its anomaly within the management regions of Alaskan waters.\nThe website features sea ice extent data for three regions defined by the Ecosystem Management Regions: the Alaskan Arctic, Eastern Bering Sea, and the Northern Bering Sea (a subset of the Eastern Bering sea).\nSea ice extent for each region is calculated using sea ice concentration data available from NOAA PolarWatch and is updated automatically when the new data are available.\n\n\nSea ice concentration represents the fraction (between 0 and 1) of the grid cell covered by sea ice. This can be estimated using satellite microwave radiometers. To compute the sea ice extent baseline (i.e., the 30-year climatology), satellite Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 were pulled from PolarWatch. The sea ice extent values of the two most recent years were computed using the Near-real-time Sea Ice Concentration data.\nClimate Data Record (CDR) of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration\nThis data set provides a CDR of sea ice concentration at 25 km resolution. Daily and monthly versions are available from 1978 to the most recent annual processing. The data are deemed of science quality. The product name is NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration, Version 4 (G02202), doi:10.7265/EFMZ-2T65.\nNear-real-time Sea Ice Concentration\nThe NRT CDR of sea ice concentration at 25 km is updated daily and used while waiting for the annual processing of the science quality CDR described above. Daily and monthly versions are available. The product name is Near Real-Time NOAA/NSIDC Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record, Version 2 (G10016), doi:10.7265/TGAM-YV28.\nPolar Stereographic Grid Cell Area\nThis dataset includes grid cell area values for the 25-km polar stereographic grid used for the sea ice concentration data.\n\n\n\nSea ice extent is calculated as the sum of the areas of each grid cell where the sea ice concentration meets or exceeds a specified threshold, indicating the presence of sea ice. Typically, that threshold is 0.15 (i.e. when the sea ice concentration estimated in that grid cell is 15% of greater, the area of the entire grid cell is used to calculate the sea ice extent). Alternatively, one can also calculate the sea ice area, in which case the grid cell area is multiplied by the sea ice concentration. Here, we work with sea ice extent.\n\n\nLet \\(sic_{ij}\\) be the satellite estimated sea ice concentration (i.e., fraction) of the \\(ij^{th}\\) grid cell covered by sea ice.\nSea ice extent of a \\({region}\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\\text{region, day}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{xgrid}, j \\in \\text{ygrid}} seaice_{ij,\\text{region, day}} \\cdot \\text{cellarea}_{ij, \\text{region}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text {where}\n\\ seaice_{ij, region, day} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } sic_{ij,\\text{region, day}} \\geq 0.15, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWorkflow of Data Processing and Computation:\n\nData Import for Baseline Import Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 within the specified regional boundaries to compute daily baseline.\nData Import for most recent years Import Near-Real-Time sea ice concentration data to the CDR time series.\nData Cleaning Remove all flag values (non-sea ice concentration values) from the dataset.\nData Conversion Convert sea ice concentration values from fractions to binary values using a threshold of 0.15 (0 indicates no ice, 1 indicates ice presence).\nSea Ice Extent Calculation Sum the grid cell areas across all grids to obtain the total sea ice extent within the regional boundaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent baseline for a given region was computed using sea ice extent from 1985 to 2015, and defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}} = Mean (\\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\\text{region, day, year} \\in [1985, 2015]})\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent anomaly for a given region was computed using sea ice extent baseline:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent anomaly}_{\\text{region, day, year}} = \\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\\text{region, day, year}} - \\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe data processing was performed using Python code and the additional computation and data visualization were done using R to be consistent with prior work done on sea surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata follows the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions and can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\nThe intended use of the data summaries, which include sea ice extent baselines and anomalies, is to compare the recent year’s sea ice extent against the 30-year baseline of sea ice extent. It is important to note that no additional data cleaning has been performed beyond what is described here.

The science quality dataset has been available since 1978.\nSea ice extent calculations primarily utilize the science quality version. However, to ensure the time series is as current as possible, near-real-time data are initially used. Once the science quality (SQ) data become available, they replace the near-real-time data in the calculations.\n\nNOAA/NSIDC. (n.d.).

    "text": "What is Sea Ice?\nSea ice is seawater that has frozen and floats in the ocean, forming exclusively within the ocean itself. Unlike sea ice, icebergs, glaciers, and ice shelves originate on land before breaking off and floating in the ocean. In the Arctic, sea ice accumulates in the fall and winter and diminishes in the spring and summer, though it does not vanish entirely.\n\n\nWhy is Sea Ice Important?\nSea ice plays profound roles in polar ecosystems, environment, climate and weather.Sea ice is crucial in polar ecosystems, environmental balance and climate, and weather patterns.\n\n\nMore Info on Sea Ice\n\nSea Ice on NOAA/NESDIS\nSeaIce on NASA Earth Observatory\nQuick Facts about Sea Ice from NSIDC\nSea Ice Data Catalog (NOAA PolarWatch)\nTutorial and code for Satellite data"
