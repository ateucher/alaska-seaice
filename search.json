    "text": "The sea ice extent is derived from the sea ice concentration remote sensing data.\n\nData\nThe NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record (CDR) Sea Ice Concentration data product\nThe NOAA/NSIDC 25-km sea ice concentration data product provides daily and monthly datasets available in two versions: science quality (SQ) and near real-time (NRT). The science quality dataset has been available since 1978.\nSea ice extent calculations primarily utilize the science quality version. However, to ensure the time series is as current as possible, near-real-time data are initially used. Once the science quality (SQ) data become available, they replace the near-real-time data in the calculations.\n\nNOAA/NSIDC. (n.d.).

Fishery management areas include the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands. No federal fisheries currently occur in the Alaskan Arctic.\nMore information about the data and sea ice extent calculation can be found on Sea Ice Extent page."
