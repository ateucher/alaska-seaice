The science quality dataset has been available since 1978.\nSea ice extent calculations primarily utilize the science quality version. However, to ensure the time series is as current as possible, near-real-time data are initially used. Once the science quality (SQ) data become available, they replace the near-real-time data in the calculations.\n\nNOAA/NSIDC. (n.d.).

    "text": "Sea ice is seawater that has frozen and floats on the ocean, forming exclusively on the ocean itself. Unlike sea ice, icebergs, glaciers, and ice shelves originate on land before breaking off and floating in the ocean. In the Arctic, sea ice forms and grows in the fall and winter and diminishes in the spring and summer, though it does not melt entirely.\n\n\n\nSea ice plays profound roles in polar ecosystems, environment, climate and weather. Sea ice is crucial in polar ecosystems, environmental balance and climate, and weather patterns. [LB 2 sentences very similar.]\nDuring summer, melting sea ice releases essential nutrients into the ocean, sparking the growth of phytoplankton as more sunlight penetrates the water. In winter, as the sea ice forms, it expels salt, altering the salinity of the water beneath. This saltier water descends, stirring the ocean layers and bringing nutrients to the surface.\nThe presence of sea ice also modulates coastal condition, dampening the wind and wave impacts. Its reflective surface sends sunlight back into space, playing a key role in climate regulation by reducing heat absorption.\nFurthermore, sea ice forms a vital habitat for various Arctic mammals.\n\nSea Ice on NOAA/NESDIS\nSeaIce on NASA Earth Observatory\nQuick Facts about Sea Ice from NSIDC\n\n\n\n\nSea ice concentration is a measurement of the amount of sea ice in a given area. Sea ice extent is the total area covered by some amount of ice, including open water between ice floes.\nIce extent is typically reported in square kilometers. Extent differentiates a region as either “ice-covered” or “not ice-covered.” A threshold determines this labeling.\nA typical threshold is 15 percent, meaning that if the grid cell has greater than 15 percent ice concentration, the cell is labeled as “ice-covered”.\n\nMore about Sea Ice Extent from NSIDC\nGet Sea Ice Satellite data (NOAA PolarWatch)\nTutorial and code for the data\n\nThe sea ice extent is derived from the sea ice concentration remote sensing data.

Unlike sea ice, icebergs, glaciers, and ice shelves originate on land before breaking off and floating in the ocean. In the Arctic, sea ice accumulates in the fall and winter and diminishes in the spring and summer, though it does not vanish entirely.\n\n\nWhy is Sea Ice Important?\nSea ice plays profound roles in polar ecosystems, environment, climate and weather.Sea ice is crucial in polar ecosystems, environmental balance and climate, and weather patterns.\n\n\nMore Info on Sea Ice\n\nSea Ice on NOAA/NESDIS\nSeaIce on NASA Earth Observatory\nQuick Facts about Sea Ice from NSIDC\nSea Ice Data Catalog (NOAA PolarWatch)\nTutorial and code for Satellite data"

The science quality dataset has been available since 1978.\nSea ice extent calculations primarily utilize the science quality version. However, to ensure the time series is as current as possible, near-real-time data are initially used. Once the science quality (SQ) data become available, they replace the near-real-time data in the calculations.\n\nNOAA/NSIDC. (n.d.).

Fishery management areas include the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands.
